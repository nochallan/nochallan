      <h3>Lok Adalat Rescheduled to January 2026</h3>
      <p>Delhi's next National Lok Adalat (settlement session) for traffic fines has been moved to January 10, 2026. Originally planned for December 13, 2025, the session was postponed after the Delhi High Court declared that date a working Saturday. The Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) announced the new date, giving motorists and litigants extra time to prepare their cases.</p>
      <p>The city-wide Lok Adalat will run simultaneously across all district court complexes and tribunals in Delhi, with the goal of resolving a large backlog of pending traffic challans. It specifically helps settle only compoundable traffic offenses, such as signal jumping, minor overspeeding, illegal parking, expired pollution certificates, and helmet/seatbelt violations. More serious charges like drunk driving or fatal accidents will continue in the regular courts.</p>
      <p>To participate, vehicle owners are advised to check their pending challans online (via the Parivahan e-Challan portal) and carry relevant documents (challan copy, vehicle registration, license, ID) to the Lok Adalat. Those with existing court cases must apply to have them listed for the January session, while others can submit cases through the DSLSA. Some courts may also offer online token booking, so drivers should verify details on official channels.</p>

      <h3>One-Time Challan Amnesty Deferred</h3>
      <p>A proposed one-time waiver scheme for pending traffic fines in Delhi was stalled in early December 2025. The Delhi Cabinet deferred approval after officials noted that multiple unpaid-fine cases were already in court, making a blanket waiver legally complicated. In other words, concerns about ongoing legal cases over unpaid challans forced a rethink of the amnesty plan.</p>
      <p>The scale of the issue is huge: officials point out that more than 22 lakh traffic challans were issued between January and July 2025 in Delhi, but only about 2% (55,000) have been paid. The draft scheme had envisioned roughly 50–70% reductions on outstanding fines for personal vehicles (two-, three-, and four-wheelers) to clear this massive backlog. The intent was to ease pressure on overburdened courts while helping drivers settle old dues.</p>
      <p>Authorities warned that motorists should take any such opportunity seriously, noting that this was a one-time relaxation. After the amnesty window, tougher measures will be considered for habitual defaulters. Possible enforcement steps include blocking certain online services on the vehicle portal or even canceling registration of vehicles whose owners repeatedly ignore fines.</p>

      <h3>Traffic Violations Surge in Delhi</h3>
      <p>Delhi has seen an unprecedented rise in traffic violations in 2025. New data from the Delhi traffic police (comparing Jan–Nov 2025 to the same period in 2024) shows steep increases across the board. Improper parking cases alone jumped about 147%, from roughly 472,000 in 2024 to over 1.16 million in 2025.</p>
      <p>Other offences also climbed significantly. Riding without a helmet nearly doubled, and driving without a licence went up 73%. Triple-riding cases jumped 63%. Even serious offences like drunk-driving and dangerous driving recorded moderate increases (around 9–17% higher than last year). Offences such as driving without insurance (up 74%) and unauthorized road use (up 45%) also saw major increases in citations.</p>
      <p>Officials attribute much of the rise to new enforcement technology and targeted drives. Automated cameras (including AI-powered systems and license-plate recognition) and focused patrols have caught many offences that previously went undetected. The traffic police say these measures, along with public awareness campaigns, have resulted in the higher recorded violation counts.</p>
